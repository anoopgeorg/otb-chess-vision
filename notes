Board : 
=> Img ===>Co-ordinates where pieces exist
- Identify the squares on the board
	
	-Convert image to grayscale 
	=> Img ===> gray_img
	
	-Use Auto Canny to get the edges 
	=> gray_img ===> edges
	
	-Sharpen the edges 
	=>edges ===>sharpened_edges
	
	-Dilate the edges sharpened_edges
	=>sharpened_edges ===>dilated_edges

	-Use LSD to get the all set of lines 
	=>dilated_edges ===>Lines

	-Eliminate the lines that do not meet certain length threshold
	=>Lines ===>Main_Lines

	-Find Sets of Parallel lines
	=>Main_Lines ===> Parallel lines			

### Assumptions
	- Need Calibration image as base line for board detector
	- Angle of the camera does not change

### To Do
Create Board Class
	Board.localize_board(): Localize board and return coordinates
		Input->  Src image
		Output-> Returns all coordinate points of the board (all intersection points of the squares on a chessboard )
	Board.find_key_points(): Finds all the points that make up squaress on the board
		Input-> Src image
		Output-> key points on the board
		Approach
